# 📰 Real-Time News Trend & Sentiment Analysis Platform

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **real-time big data pipeline** for collecting, processing, and analyzing global news articles (e.g., Reuters, Irish Times, Wall Street Journal).  
It combines **batch analytics** for historical insights with **real-time streaming** for emerging trends and sentiment monitoring.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect and ingest live news articles from multiple publishers.
- Detect trending topics and perform sentiment analysis in near real-time.
- Store historical data for deeper offline analysis.
- Provide dashboards and interactive queries for insights.

## 🔑 Components
- **Data Source**: RSS feeds/APIs from Reuters, WSJ, Irish Times, etc.
- **Ingestion (Kafka)**: Streams articles into topics (`news_raw`, `news_processed`).
- **Batch Layer (Spark Batch + HDFS)**:  
  - Historical topic modeling & sentiment classification with Spark MLlib.  
  - Storage of raw data and trained models in HDFS.
- **Speed Layer (Spark Structured Streaming)**:  
  - Real-time processing with windowing & watermarking.  
  - Trending keywords and sentiment counts stored in MongoDB/Cassandra.
- **Query & Analytics (Presto)**: Distributed SQL queries across HDFS + NoSQL.
- **Deployment (Kubernetes)**: Containerized Kafka, Spark, Presto, and DB services.
- **Visualization**: Grafana/Kibana/React dashboards for trends and sentiment.

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time ingestion of articles.
- Sentiment classification (positive, neutral, negative).
- Trending topic detection (window-based).
- Historical analysis using batch ML.
- Interactive querying and dashboards.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **Throughput**: Articles processed per second.
- **Latency**: End-to-end delay (<3s target).
- **Accuracy**: Sentiment classifier F1-score.
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle more publishers and higher ingestion rates.

## 📦 Deliverables
- End-to-end data pipeline (Kafka → Spark → HDFS/NoSQL).
- ML models for sentiment/topic analysis.
- Kubernetes deployment manifests.
- Real-time analytics dashboard.
- Final documentation and presentation.
